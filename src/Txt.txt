## react intro

    What is React?

    1) React is a JavaScript library (not a framework) developed by Facebook (Meta) for building user interfaces (UIs), especially Single Page Applications (SPAs).

    2) It helps developers build reusable UI components that update efficiently when data changes.

    Instead of reloading a whole webpage when something changes, React updates only the parts of the UI that need to change.

    -------
    Why do we need React?

	It makes UI development faster, cleaner, and more efficient.

	Provides a better user experience with smooth updates without page reloads.

## styleing

    gobal styleing
    seperate file style
    inline style
    Object way style
    module way style

## props

    props is nothing but drilling data from one compontent to 
    another component.

        Props.variable
        destructure of props

## Usestate()

    Usestate is a react hook that allows you to add state (data that can changes over time) 
    to a functional component.

    normaly ,in js functions, variables disappear after the function runs. but with Usestate
    ,react remembres values b/w re-renders.

    const [state,setstate]=Usestate(initialvalue)

    state --the current value of the state variable
    setstate --a function that updates the state
    initialvalue -- the starting value of the state

## Conditional rendering 

    Conditional rendering means showing or hideing of UI based on some condition.

        Ternary operator
        Logical operator

## list rendering 

    Rendering multipe items dynamically using .map(),.reduce(),.filter()...

## form & controlled components useing Usestate()


npm install or npm i

npm run dev

## useEffect()

    useEffect is a hook that lets you perform side effect if a functionaal components.
    side effect are task that happends outside the normal react rendering process.

        featching data from API.
        Updating the browser DOm manually
        Start/stop timers

     useEffect(()=>{
        //code
     },[dependency 1, dependency 2,....])

    if we don't mension the dependency means it will execut initally one time.

## useref()

    useref is a react hook  that gives you a box (.current) you can store anything in 
    like num,str,obj,fun,even DOM elements

    That value presists between renders

    Updating it does not causes your component to re-render

    {current:value}

    Syntax:

        const refContainer =useref(initialvalue)

## useContext()

    Passing data from a parent component down to deeply nested child component is annoying.
    Normally,you'd have to pass props mnually through each level (calling props drilling)
    useContext lets you skip all the  middle component and share the data directly

        Create a Context
        Provide a value
        Consume the value


## useReducer()

    syntex

        const[state,dispatch]=useReducer(reducerfunction,initialState)

    state-- current state (like Usestate value)
    dispatch--a function to tell the render what to do
    reducerfunction-- the logical that return a new state
    initialState-- starting value

## usecallBack()

    Every time a component re-renders, it creates a brand new copy of every 
    function inside it.

    even if the function code look exactly the same,
    react sees it as different because it's a new objects in memeory.

    syntex:

        const  variableName= useCallback(()=>{
            //code
        },[dependency])

## Routing in react and nested routing..

    Routing means navigation between pages in a web application without refreshing the browser.
    In traditional websites,clicking a link relads the whole page.
    In react (SAP) ,Routing lets us changes the view  without reloading.

        better performance (no full page reloag)
        smooth user experiance
        Control over navigation without serrvar request
    
    commend: npm install react-router-dom

    structure:
            <BrowserRoute>
            <Routers>
            <route path={} element={} />
            </Routers>
            </BrowserRoute>

    <BrowserRoute>--
        it tell react to use routing in your app.
        it keep your UI in syn with URL in the browser

    Routers---

        it's a container that holds all your different pages routes.
        it decides which page to show based on the URL

    route--

        it defines which component to show for a specific path (URL)

 ## useId()

    useId() , is a react hook  tha creates a unique ID for each components instances.

    it's mainly used to link html elements together- for ex . connecting a label and  input 
    tag or for accessability purposes.

    it creates a unique, consistant and reuseable ID ffor each components  instances- 
    helpful for linking element like tooltips safety and accessibility. 
 
 ## useActionState()--- mainly used for form tag

     useActionState is a react hook used to track manage the state of asynchronous useActionState
     -- likr submitting a form or operation -- without  manually eriting a lot  od Usestate 
     and useEffect logical

        it help in:
            the pending (loading)state
            the result (success or failuer) state
            the error (if the action throws an exception)

    syntex:

        const[state,formAction,isPending]=useActionState(action,initialState)

        action-- a function that performe the async work (like submitting)
        initialState-- starting value
        state-- result returned from the action
        formAction-- function you can call or use in aform action attribute
        isPending state-- boolean  that tells if the action is currly running.

    ## Useparam() -- routing dom

        useParams() is a React Router hook that lets you read dynamic values from the URL path (not from the query string).

		It’s commonly used when you have routes with dynamic segments like /users/:id or /products/:productId.
